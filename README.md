## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app on your iOS or Android device.
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase for authentication and database storage. You'll need to set up your own Firebase project.

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Enable Firestore:** In the console, go to `Build > Firestore Database` and create a database. Start in **test mode** for easy setup (you can change security rules later).
3.  **Enable Authentication:** Go to `Build > Authentication` and enable the "Email/Password" sign-in method.
4.  **Get Config:** Go to your Project Settings (click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è) and under the "General" tab, scroll down to "Your apps".
5.  Click the web icon `</>` to create a new web app.
6.  After creating the app, you will be given a `firebaseConfig` object. Copy this object.
7.  Create a file named `firebaseConfig.js` (or `.ts`) in the root of the project and paste your config object into it, like so:

    ```javascript
    // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
    import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
    import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
    import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

    // Your web app's Firebase configuration
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
      messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
    };

    // Initialize Firebase
    const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
    export const db = getFirestore(app);
    export const auth = getAuth(app);
    ```

    > **Important:** The `firebaseConfig.js` file contains sensitive keys. Ensure it is added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to your repository.

### Installation & Launch

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Rp0115/Workout-Tracker.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Workout-Tracker
    ```
3.  **Install NPM dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Launch the application:**
    ```sh
    npx expo start
    ```
    - This will start the Metro bundler. You can now open the app on your phone by scanning the QR code with the Expo Go app.
